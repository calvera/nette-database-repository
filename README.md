# Nette Database Repository

Nette Database is a library that enhances the functionality of the popular Nette/Database package by adding support for typed
entities, queries (Selections) and repositories. It provides a convenient way to define and work with strongly-typed entities in your
database-driven applications. This extension aims to improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the risk of errors related to
data types.

## Installation

The best way to install this extension is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
$ composer require nette-database-repository/core
```

Register our configuration:
```neon
includes:
    - %appDir%/../vendor/nette-database-repository/core/config.neon
```

Execute our repository code generation command:
```sh
$ php bin/console repository:code-gen
```

## Usage

### Entity

The `Entity` class extends `ActiveRow` but is made to be used as a base class for your entities. 
It is supposed to be generated by our code generation tool, but you can also write it manually.

#### Inserting an entity

```php
assert($repository instanceof PersonRepository);
assert($entity instanceof Person);
$entity = $repository->createRow();
$entity->name = 'John';
$entity->surname = 'Doe';
$entity->age = 42;
$entity->save();
```

Classic:
```php
$person = $repository->insert([
    Person::name => 'John',
    Person::surname => 'Doe',
    Person::age => 42,
]);
```

Multi-insert:
```php
$persons = [];
foreach (range(30, 40) as $age) {
    $person = $repository->createRow();
    $person->name = 'John';
    $person->surname = 'Doe';
    $person->age = $age;
    $persons[] = $person;
}
$repository->insert($persons);
```

#### Updating an entity

```php
$entity = $repository->find($id);
$entity->name = 'Jake';
$entity->save();
```

Classic:
```php
$repository->update($id, [
    Person::name => 'Jake',
]);
```

#### Deleting an entity

```php
$entity = $repository->find($id);
$entity->delete();
```

Or:
```php
$repository->delete($id);
```

### Traits (Behaviors and Event Subscribers)

#### DateBehavior
DateBehavior ensures that the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns are automatically filled with the current date and time on insert and update.
